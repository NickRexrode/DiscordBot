# DiscordBot
A discord bot that can play music on command.

Discord.js and Typescript.
Connects to an Express backend to store and serve data.

Currently refactoring / rewriting the majority of the bot to address major concerns (stability, controlling how the audio sounds, major bugs) as well as readability.  When I started making this I did not know how much I would add to it.
